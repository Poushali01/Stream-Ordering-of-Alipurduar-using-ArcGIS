# 🌍 Stream Ordering in Alipurduar District using ArcGIS  

## 📌 Project Overview                                            
- 📍 *Location:* Alipurduar District, West Bengal, India  
- 🗺 *Software Used:* ArcGIS, Python  
- 🏞 *Data Used:* Digital Elevation Model (DEM)  

## 📂 Dataset Overview  
 Raw Data Source for SRTM DEM is downloded from USGS Earth Explorer and The shapefile used in this project was provided for academic purposes. Similar datasets can be accessed from publicly available sources like OpenStreetMap, Bhuvan (ISRO), or government GIS portals.
The following datasets are used in this project:

### 🗺 1. Raw Data  
- - [Alipurduar DEM (Fill Analyst)](https://github.com/Poushali01/My-Geospatial-Project/raw/main/Alipurduar%20DEM%20(Fill%20Analyst).zip)  
- [Alipurduar Shapefile](https://github.com/Poushali01/My-Geospatial-Project/raw/main/Alipurduar%20Shapefile.zip)

### 🔍 2. Processed Data  
- [Flow Direction](https://github.com/Poushali01/My-Geospatial-Project/raw/main/Flow%20Direction.zip)    

### 📊 3. Outputs  
- [Stream Ordering](https://github.com/Poushali01/My-Geospatial-Project/raw/main/Stream%20Ordering.zip)

## 🚀 How to Use  
The following workflow was used to analyze the stream network of Alipurduar using ArcGIS hydrological tools:

1️⃣ Fill DEM → Remove sinks and smoothen water flow.
2️⃣ Flow Direction → Generate a raster showing water movement.
3️⃣ Flow Accumulation → Identify major drainage paths.
4️⃣ Set Threshold Value → Use Raster Calculator to filter significant streams.
5️⃣ Stream Ordering → Classify streams using Strahler's method.
6️⃣ Convert to Vector → Transform streams into vector format for better visualization.
7️⃣ Final Layout & Map Composition → Prepare the final map.

🔹 Tools Used → ArcGIS Spatial Analyst, Raster Calculator, and Cartography tools.


## 🛠 Code Used  
The following Python commands were executed in the *ArcGIS Python Prompt* to generate stream ordering of Alipurduar:

```python
import arcpy  
from arcpy.sa import  

# Fill sinks in the DEM
fill = Fill("Alipurduar_DEM")

# Compute Flow Direction
flow_di = FlowDirection("Fill_Dem", "NORMAL")

# Compute Flow Accumulation
flow_accumulation = FlowAccumulation("Flow_Direction", "Fill_Dem", "FLOAT")

# Compute Stream Order using the Strahler method
stream_ordering = StreamOrder("Flow_Raster", "Flow_Direction", "STRAHLER")

# Convert Stream Order raster to vector features
stream_to_feature = StreamToFeature("Stream_Order", "Flow_Direction", "Stream")
